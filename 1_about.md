I am interested in studying the evolutionary impact of structural variation in plant genomes, with particular focus on gene presence/absence variation and genome duplications. I'm most interested in understanding the combination of neutral and adaptive features that maintain extra copies of 
genomes and how extra copies can be used to evolve novel traits. 

I am currently an NSF Plant Genome Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UC Davis working with [Dan Kliebenstein](https://psfaculty.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/kliebenstein/) and [Grey Monroe](https://www.monroelab.org/). My project focuses on how gene network topology relates to epistasis. Specifically, I am using natural loss-of-function alleles in *Arabidopsis thaliana* to explore how gene networks may constrain and structure genetic variation to maintain mutational robustness while permitting, and even facilitating, adaptive evolution. Additionally I am also working on pan-genome projects and genome evolution across the Brassicaceae.

I completed my PhD in Horticulture and Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at Michigan State University with [Pat Edger](www.polyploidy.msu.edu) and [Bob Van Buren](https://www.vanburenlab.org/). My dissertation work focused on the genomics and genome evolution of allopolyploids with special attention paid to the causes and consequences of subgenome dominance, gene dosage constraints on genome duplications and homoeologous exchanges, and the use phylogenomics to understand the evolution and origin of complex polyploid species.

Prior to my PhD work, I received a BS in Biological Sciences and a BA in Philosophy from the University of Missouri-Columbia where I was advised by [J. Chris Pires](https://pires.biology.missouri.edu) . There, I collaborated with the USDA and [Michael Gore](https://blogs.cornell.edu/gorelab/) to sequence a diverse panel of Brassica rapa (e.g. turnip, pak choi, chinese cabbage, etc) and learn about population structure and evolutionary relationships of different cultivars (see publications). Afterwards, I was a Fulbright fellow at the VIB/Ugent under [Steven Maere](https://www.psb.ugent.be/esb/ESB/Home.html) where I assisted on a project investigating the evolution of gene regulatory networks using a novel mechanistic modeling framework.
